Q1. Which API you used
Ans. I have used the CoinGecko API for data fetching.

Q2. What data you extracted
Ans. I have extracted the price and timestamp of the coin and then calculated the metrics using
the price and timestamp like volatility(daily, annual), Risk ratio(ie. Shrape Ratio) and 
Beta(ie. comparison with BTC).

Q3. Why visualization is useful
Ans. visualization is useful as it turns the heavy numerical data into charts and visual representation
which could be more easily understood by an investor.
